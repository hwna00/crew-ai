We will also explore the various career paths in machine learning and provide guidance on how to start your journey in this exciting field.Become a ML ScientistMaster Python skills to become a machine learning scientistStart Learning for FreeWhat is Machine Learning?\n",
      "Machine Learning, often abbreviated as ML, is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. In simpler terms, machine learning enables computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n",
      "At its core, machine learning is all about creating and implementing algorithms that facilitate these decisions and predictions. These algorithms are designed to improve their performance over time, becoming more accurate and effective as they process more data.\n",
      "In traditional programming, a computer follows a set of predefined instructions to perform a task. However, in machine learning, the computer is given a set of examples (data) and a task to perform, but it's up to the computer to figure out how to accomplish the task based on the examples it's given.\n",
      "For instance, if we want a computer to recognize images of cats, we don't provide it with specific instructions on what a cat looks like. Instead, we give it thousands of images of cats and let the machine learning algorithm figure out the common patterns and features that define a cat. Over time, as the algorithm processes more images, it gets better at recognizing cats, even when presented with images it has never seen before.\n",
      "This ability to learn from data and improve over time makes machine learning incredibly powerful and versatile. It's the driving force behind many of the technological advancements we see today, from voice assistants and recommendation systems to self-driving cars and predictive analytics.\n",
      "Machine learning vs AI vs deep learning\n",
      "Machine learning is often confused with artificial intelligence or deep learning. Let's take a look at how these terms differ from one another. For a more in-depth look, check out our comparison guides on AI vs machine learning and machine learning vs deep learning. \n",
      "AI refers to the development of programs that behave intelligently and mimic human intelligence through a set of algorithms. The field focuses on three skills: learning, reasoning, and self-correction to obtain maximum efficiency. AI can refer to either machine learning-based programs or even explicitly programmed computer programs.\n",
      "Machine learning is a subset of AI, which uses algorithms that learn from data to make predictions. These predictions can be generated through supervised learning, where algorithms learn patterns from existing data, or unsupervised learning, where they discover general patterns in data. ML models can predict numerical values based on historical data, categorize events as true or false, and cluster data points based on commonalities.\n",
      "Deep learning, on the other hand, is a subfield of machine learning dealing with algorithms based essentially on multi-layered artificial neural networks (ANN) that are inspired by the structure of the human brain.\n",
      "Unlike conventional machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms are less linear, more complex, and hierarchical, capable of learning from enormous amounts of data, and able to produce highly accurate results. Language translation, image recognition, and personalized medicines are some examples of deep learning applications.\n",
      "Comparing different industry terms\n",
      "The Importance of Machine Learning\n",
      "In the 21st century, data is the new oil, and machine learning is the engine that powers this data-driven world. It is a critical technology in today's digital age, and its importance cannot be overstated. This is reflected in the industry's projected growth, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicting a 21% growth in jobs between 2021 and 2031.\n",
      "Here are some reasons why it’s so essential in the modern world:\n",
      "Data processing. One of the primary reasons machine learning is so important is its ability to handle and make sense of large volumes of data. With the explosion of digital data from social media, sensors, and other sources, traditional data analysis methods have become inadequate. Machine learning algorithms can process these vast amounts of data, uncover hidden patterns, and provide valuable insights that can drive decision-making.\n",
      "Driving innovation. Machine learning is driving innovation and efficiency across various sectors. Here are a few examples:\n",
      "Healthcare. Algorithms are used to predict disease outbreaks, personalize patient treatment plans, and improve medical imaging accuracy.\n",
      "Finance. Machine learning is used for credit scoring, algorithmic trading, and fraud detection.\n",
      "Retail. Recommendation systems, supply chains, and customer service can all benefit from machine learning.\n",
      "The techniques used also find applications in sectors as diverse as agriculture, education, and entertainment.\n",
      "Enabling automation. Machine learning is a key enabler of automation. By learning from data and improving over time, machine learning algorithms can perform previously manual tasks, freeing humans to focus on more complex and creative tasks. This not only increases efficiency but also opens up new possibilities for innovation.\n",
      "How Does Machine Learning Work?\n",
      "Understanding how machine learning works involves delving into a step-by-step process that transforms raw data into valuable insights. Let's break down this process:\n",
      "See the full workflow here\n",
      "Step 1: Data collection\n",
      "The first step in the machine learning process is data collection. Data is the lifeblood of machine learning - the quality and quantity of your data can directly impact your model's performance. Data can be collected from various sources such as databases, text files, images, audio files, or even scraped from the web.\n",
      "Once collected, the data needs to be prepared for machine learning. This process involves organizing the data in a suitable format, such as a CSV file or a database, and ensuring that the data is relevant to the problem you're trying to solve.\n",
      "Step 2: Data preprocessing\n",
      "Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning process. It involves cleaning the data (removing duplicates, correcting errors), handling missing data (either by removing it or filling it in), and normalizing the data (scaling the data to a standard format).\n",
      "Preprocessing improves the quality of your data and ensures that your machine learning model can interpret it correctly. This step can significantly improve the accuracy of your model. Our course, Preprocessing for Machine Learning in Python, explores how to get your cleaned data ready for modeling.\n",
      "Step 3: Choosing the right model\n",
      "Once the data is prepared, the next step is to choose a machine learning model. There are many types of models to choose from, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The choice of model depends on the nature of your data and the problem you're trying to solve.\n",
      "Factors to consider when choosing a model include the size and type of your data, the complexity of the problem, and the computational resources available. You can read more about the different machine learning models in a separate article.\n",
      "Step 4: Training the model\n",
      "After choosing a model, the next step is to train it using the prepared data. Training involves feeding the data into the model and allowing it to adjust its internal parameters to better predict the output.\n",
      "During training, it's important to avoid overfitting (where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data) and underfitting (where the model performs poorly on both the training data and new data). You can learn more about the full machine learning process in our Machine Learning Fundamentals with Python skill track, which explores the essential concepts and how to apply them.\n",
      "Step 5: Evaluating the model\n",
      "Once the model is trained, it's important to evaluate its performance before deploying it. This involves testing the model on new data it hasn't seen during training.\n",
      "Common metrics for evaluating a model's performance include accuracy (for classification problems), precision and recall (for binary classification problems), and mean squared error (for regression problems). We cover this evaluation process in more detail in our Responsible AI webinar.\n",
      "Step 6: Hyperparameter tuning and optimization\n",
      "After evaluating the model, you may need to adjust its hyperparameters to improve its performance. This process is known as parameter tuning or hyperparameter optimization.\n",
      "Techniques for hyperparameter tuning include grid search (where you try out different combinations of parameters) and cross validation (where you divide your data into subsets and train your model on each subset to ensure it performs well on different data).\n",
      "We have a separate article on hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models, which covers the topic in more detail.\n",
      "Step 7: Predictions and deployment\n",
      "Once the model is trained and optimized, it's ready to make predictions on new data. This process involves feeding new data into the model and using the model's output for decision-making or further analysis.\n",
      "Deploying the model involves integrating it into a production environment where it can process real-world data and provide real-time insights. This process is often known as MLOps. Discover more about MLOps in a separate tutorial.\n",
      "Types of Machine Learning\n",
      "Machine learning can be broadly classified into three types based on the nature of the learning system and the data available: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Let's delve into each of these:\n",
      "Supervised learning\n",
      "Supervised learning is the most common type of machine learning. In this approach, the model is trained on a labeled dataset. In other words, the data is accompanied by a label that the model is trying to predict. This could be anything from a category label to a real-valued number.\n",
      "The model learns a mapping between the input (features) and the output (label) during the training process. Once trained, the model can predict the output for new, unseen data.\n",
      "Common examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression for regression problems and logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines for classification problems. In practical terms, this could look like an image recognition process, wherein a dataset of images where each picture is labeled as \"cat,\" \"dog,\" etc., a supervised model can recognize and categorize new images accurately.\n",
      "Unsupervised learning\n",
      "Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves training the model on an unlabeled dataset. The model is left to find patterns and relationships in the data on its own.\n",
      "This type of learning is often used for clustering and dimensionality reduction. Clustering involves grouping similar data points together, while dimensionality reduction involves reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.\n",
      "Common examples of unsupervised learning algorithms include k-means for clustering problems and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction problems. Again, in practical terms, in the field of marketing, unsupervised learning is often used to segment a company's customer base. By examining purchasing patterns, demographic data, and other information, the algorithm can group customers into segments that exhibit similar behaviors without any pre-existing labels.\n",
      "Comparing supervised and unsupervised learning\n",
      "Reinforcement learning\n",
      "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. The agent is rewarded or penalized (with points) for the actions it takes, and its goal is to maximize the total reward.\n",
      "Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is particularly suited to problems where the data is sequential, and the decision made at each step can affect future outcomes.\n",
      "Common examples of reinforcement learning include game playing, robotics, resource management, and many more.\n",
      "Understanding the Impact of Machine Learning\n",
      "Machine Learning has had a transformative impact across various industries, revolutionizing traditional processes and paving the way for innovation. Let's explore some of these impacts:\n",
      "“Machine learning is the most transformative technology of our time. It’s going to transform every single vertical.”\n",
      "- Satya Nadella, CEO at Microsoft\n",
      "Healthcare\n",
      "In healthcare, machine learning is used to predict disease outbreaks, personalize patient treatment plans, and improve medical imaging accuracy. For instance, Google's DeepMind Health is working with doctors to build machine learning models to detect diseases earlier and improve patient care.\n",
      "Finance\n",
      "The finance sector has also greatly benefited from machine learning. It's used for credit scoring, algorithmic trading, and fraud detection. A recent survey found that 56% of global executives said that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have been implemented into financial crime compliance programs.\n",
      "Transportation\n",
      "Machine learning is at the heart of the self-driving car revolution. Companies like Tesla and Waymo use machine learning algorithms to interpret sensor data in real-time, allowing their vehicles to recognize objects, make decisions, and navigate roads autonomously. Similarly, the Swedish Transport Administration recently started working with computer vision and machine learning specialists to optimize the country’s road infrastructure management.\n",
      "Some Applications of Machine Learning\n",
      "Machine learning applications are all around us, often working behind the scenes to enhance our daily lives. Here are some real-world examples:\n",
      "Recommendation systems\n",
      "Recommendation systems are one of the most visible applications of machine learning. Companies like Netflix and Amazon use machine learning to analyze your past behavior and recommend products or movies you might like. Learn how to build a recommendation engine in Python with our online course.\n",
      "Voice assistants\n",
      "Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use machine learning to understand your voice commands and provide relevant responses. They continually learn from your interactions to improve their performance.\n",
      "Fraud detection\n",
      "Banks and credit card companies use machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions. By analyzing patterns of normal and abnormal behavior, they can flag suspicious activity in real-time. We have a fraud detection in Python course, which explores the concept in more detail.\n",
      "Social media\n",
      "Social media platforms use machine learning for a variety of tasks, from personalizing your feed to filtering out inappropriate content.\n",
      "Our machine learning cheat sheet covers different algorithms and their uses\n",
      "Machine Learning Tools\n",
      "In the world of machine learning, having the right tools is just as important as understanding the concepts.

      "When companies today deploy artificial intelligence programs, they are most likely using machine learning — so much so that the terms are often used interchangeably, and sometimes ambiguously. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.\n",
      "“In just the last five or 10 years, machine learning has become a critical way, arguably the most important way, most parts of AI are done,” said MIT Sloan professorThomas W. Malone, the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. “So that's why some people use the terms AI and machine learning almost as synonymous … most of the current advances in AI have involved machine learning.”\n",

      "Leave this field blank\n",
      "With the growing ubiquity of machine learning, everyone in business is likely to encounter it and will need some working knowledge about this field. A 2020 Deloitte survey found that 67% of companies are using machine learning, and 97% are using or planning to use it in the next year.\n",
      "From manufacturing to retail and banking to bakeries, even legacy companies are using machine learning to unlock new value or boost efficiency. “Machine learning is changing, or will change, every industry, and leaders need to understand the basic principles, the potential, and the limitations,” said MIT computer science professor Aleksander Madry, director of the MIT Center for Deployable Machine Learning.\n",
      "While not everyone needs to know the technical details, they should understand what the technology does and what it can and cannot do, Madry added. “I don’t think anyone can afford not to be aware of what’s happening.”\n",
      "That includes being aware of the social, societal, and ethical implications of machine learning. “It's important to engage and begin to understand these tools, and then think about how you're going to use them well. We have to use these [tools] for the good of everybody,” said Dr. Joan LaRovere, MBA ’16, a pediatric cardiac intensive care physician and co-founder of the nonprofit The Virtue Foundation. “AI has so much potential to do good, and we need to really keep that in our lenses as we're thinking about this. How do we use this to do good and better the world?”\n",
      "What is machine learning? \n",
      "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems are used to perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.\n",
      "The goal of AI is to create computer models that exhibit “intelligent behaviors” like humans, according to Boris Katz, a principal research scientist and head of the InfoLab Group at CSAIL. This means machines that can recognize a visual scene, understand a text written in natural language, or perform an action in the physical world.\n",
      "Machine learning is one way to use AI. It was defined in the 1950s by AI pioneer Arthur Samuel as “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed.”\n",
      "The definition holds true, according toMikey Shulman, a lecturer at MIT Sloan and head of machine learning at Kensho, which specializes in artificial intelligence for the finance and U.S. intelligence communities. He compared the traditional way of programming computers, or “software 1.0,” to baking, where a recipe calls for precise amounts of ingredients and tells the baker to mix for an exact amount of time. Traditional programming similarly requires creating detailed instructions for the computer to follow.\n",
      "But in some cases, writing a program for the machine to follow is time-consuming or impossible, such as training a computer to recognize pictures of different people. While humans can do this task easily, it’s difficult to tell a computer how to do it. Machine learning takes the approach of letting computers learn to program themselves through experience. \n",
      "Machine learning starts with data — numbers, photos, or text, like bank transactions, pictures of people or even bakery items, repair records, time series data from sensors, or sales reports. The data is gathered and prepared to be used as training data, or the information the machine learning model will be trained on. The more data, the better the program.\n",
      "From there, programmers choose a machine learning model to use, supply the data, and let the computer model train itself to find patterns or make predictions. Over time the human programmer can also tweak the model, including changing its parameters, to help push it toward more accurate results. (Research scientist Janelle Shane’s website AI Weirdness is an entertaining look at how machine learning algorithms learn and how they can get things wrong — as happened when an algorithm tried to generate recipes and created Chocolate Chicken Chicken Cake.)\n",
      "Some data is held out from the training data to be used as evaluation data, which tests how accurate the machine learning model is when it is shown new data. The result is a model that can be used in the future with different sets of data.\n",
      "Successful machine learning algorithms can do different things, Malone wrote in a recent research brief about AI and the future of work that was co-authored by MIT professor and CSAIL director Daniela Rus and Robert Laubacher, the associate director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.\n",
      "“The function of a machine learning system can be descriptive, meaning that the system uses the data to explain what happened; predictive, meaning the system uses the data to predict what will happen; or prescriptive, meaning the system will use the data to make suggestions about what action to take,” the researchers wrote.  \n",
      "There are three subcategories of machine learning:\n",
      "Supervised machine learning models are trained with labeled data sets, which allow the models to learn and grow more accurate over time. For example, an algorithm would be trained with pictures of dogs and other things, all labeled by humans, and the machine would learn ways to identify pictures of dogs on its own. Supervised machine learning is the most common type used today.\n",
      "In unsupervised machine learning, a program looks for patterns in unlabeled data. Unsupervised machine learning can find patterns or trends that people aren’t explicitly looking for. For example, an unsupervised machine learning program could look through online sales data and identify different types of clients making purchases.\n",
      "Reinforcement machine learning trains machines through trial and error to take the best action by establishing a reward system. Reinforcement learning can train models to play games or train autonomous vehicles to drive by telling the machine when it made the right decisions, which helps it learn over time what actions it should take.\n",

      "Source: Thomas Malone | MIT Sloan. See: https://bit.ly/3gvRho2, Figure 2.\n",
      "In the Work of the Future brief, Malone noted that machine learning is best suited for situations with lots of data — thousands or millions of examples, like recordings from previous conversations with customers, sensor logs from machines, or ATM transactions. For example, Google Translate was possible because it “trained” on the vast amount of information on the web, in different languages.\n",
      "In some cases, machine learning can gain insight or automate decision-making in cases where humans would not be able to, Madry said. “It may not only be more efficient and less costly to have an algorithm do this, but sometimes humans just literally are not able to do it,” he said.\n",
      "Google search is an example of something that humans can do, but never at the scale and speed at which the Google models are able to show potential answers every time a person types in a query, Malone said. “That’s not an example of computers putting people out of work. It's an example of computers doing things that would not have been remotely economically feasible if they had to be done by humans.”\n",
      "Machine learning is also associated with several other artificial intelligence subfields:\n",
      "Natural language processing \n",
      "Natural language processing is a field of machine learning in which machines learn to understand natural language as spoken and written by humans, instead of the data and numbers normally used to program computers. This allows machines to recognize language, understand it, and respond to it, as well as create new text and translate between languages. Natural language processing enables familiar technology like chatbots and digital assistants like Siri or Alexa.\n",
      "Neural networks\n",
      "Neural networks are a commonly used, specific class of machine learning algorithms. Artificial neural networks are modeled on the human brain, in which thousands or millions of processing nodes are interconnected and organized into layers.\n",
      "In an artificial neural network, cells, or nodes, are connected, with each cell processing inputs and producing an output that is sent to other neurons. Labeled data moves through the nodes, or cells, with each cell performing a different function. In a neural network trained to identify whether a picture contains a cat or not, the different nodes would assess the information and arrive at an output that indicates whether a picture features a cat.\n",
      "Deep learning\n",
      "Deep learning networks are neural networks with many layers. The layered network can process extensive amounts of data and determine the “weight” of each link in the network — for example, in an image recognition system, some layers of the neural network might detect individual features of a face, like eyes, nose, or mouth, while another layer would be able to tell whether those features appear in a way that indicates a face.  \n",
      "Like neural networks, deep learning is modeled on the way the human brain works and powers many machine learning uses, like autonomous vehicles, chatbots, and medical diagnostics.\n",
      "“The more layers you have, the more potential you have for doing complex things well,” Malone said.\n",
      "Deep learning requires a great deal of computing power, which raises concerns about its economic and environmental sustainability.\n",
      "How businesses are using machine learning\n",
      "Machine learning is the core of some companies’ business models, like in the case of Netflix’s suggestions algorithm or Google’s search engine. Other companies are engaging deeply with machine learning, though it’s not their main business proposition.\n",
      "67%\n",
      "Share\n",
      "67% of companies are using machine learning, according to a recent survey.\n",
      "Others are still trying to determine how to use machine learning in a beneficial way. “In my opinion, one of the hardest problems in machine learning is figuring out what problems I can solve with machine learning,” Shulman said. “There’s still a gap in the understanding.” \n",
      "In a 2018 paper, researchers from the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy outlined a 21-question rubric to determine whether a task is suitable for machine learning. The researchers found that no occupation will be untouched by machine learning, but no occupation is likely to be completely taken over by it. The way to unleash machine learning success, the researchers found, was to reorganize jobs into discrete tasks, some which can be done by machine learning, and others that require a human.\n",
      "Companies are already using machine learning in several ways, including:\n",
      "Recommendation algorithms. The recommendation engines behind Netflix and YouTube suggestions, what information appears on your Facebook feed, and product recommendations are fueled by machine learning. “[The algorithms] are trying to learn our preferences,” Madry said. “They want to learn, like on Twitter, what tweets we want them to show us, on Facebook, what ads to display, what posts or liked content to share with us.”\n",
      "Image analysis and object detection. Machine learning can analyze images for different information, like learning to identify people and tell them apart — though facial recognition algorithms are controversial. Business uses for this vary. Shulman noted that hedge funds famously use machine learning to analyze the number of cars in parking lots, which helps them learn how companies are performing and make good bets.\n",
      "Fraud detection. Machines can analyze patterns, like how someone normally spends or where they normally shop, to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions, log-in attempts, or spam emails.\n",
      "Automatic helplines or chatbots. Many companies are deploying online chatbots, in which customers or clients don’t speak to humans, but instead interact with a machine. These algorithms use machine learning and natural language processing, with the bots learning from records of past conversations to come up with appropriate responses.\n",
      "Self-driving cars. Much of the technology behind self-driving cars is based on machine learning, deep learning in particular.\n",
      "Medical imaging and diagnostics. Machine learning programs can be trained to examine medical images or other information and look for certain markers of illness, like a tool that can predict cancer risk based on a mammogram.\n",

      "While machine learning is fueling technology that can help workers or open new possibilities for businesses, there are several things business leaders should know about machine learning and its limits.\n",
      "Explainability \n",
      "One area of concern is what some experts call explainability, or the ability to be clear about what the machine learning models are doing and how they make decisions. “Understanding why a model does what it does is actually a very difficult question, and you always have to ask yourself that,” Madry said. “You should never treat this as a black box, that just comes as an oracle … yes, you should use it, but then try to get a feeling of what are the rules of thumb that it came up with? And then validate them.”\n",

      "Why finance is deploying natural language processing\n",
      "This is especially important because systems can be fooled and undermined, or just fail on certain tasks, even those humans can perform easily. For example, adjusting the metadata in images can confuse computers — with a few adjustments, a machine identifies a picture of a dog as an ostrich.\n",
      "Madry pointed out another example in which a machine learning algorithm examining X-rays seemed to outperform physicians. But it turned out the algorithm was correlating results with the machines that took the image, not necessarily the image itself. Tuberculosis is more common in developing countries, which tend to have older machines. The machine learning program learned that if the X-ray was taken on an older machine, the patient was more likely to have tuberculosis. It completed the task, but not in the way the programmers intended or would find useful.\n",
      "The importance of explaining how a model is working — and its accuracy — can vary depending on how it’s being used, Shulman said. While most well-posed problems can be solved through machine learning, he said, people should assume right now that the models only perform to about 95% of human accuracy. It might be okay with the programmer and the viewer if an algorithm recommending movies is 95% accurate, but that level of accuracy wouldn’t be enough for a self-driving vehicle or a program designed to find serious flaws in machinery.   \n",
      "Bias and unintended outcomes\n",
      "Machines are trained by humans, and human biases can be incorporated into algorithms — if biased information, or data that reflects existing inequities, is fed to a machine learning program, the program will learn to replicate it and perpetuate forms of discrimination. Chatbots trained on how people converse on Twitter can pick up on offensive and racist language, for example.\n",
      "In some cases, machine learning models create or exacerbate social problems. For example, Facebook has used machine learning as a tool to show users ads and content that will interest and engage them — which has led to models showing people extreme content that leads to polarization and the spread of conspiracy theories when people are shown incendiary, partisan, or inaccurate content.\n",
      "Ways to fight against bias in machine learning including carefully vetting training data and putting organizational support behind ethical artificial intelligence efforts, like making sure your organization embraces human-centered AI, the practice of seeking input from people of different backgrounds, experiences, and lifestyles when designing AI systems. Initiatives working on this issue include the Algorithmic Justice League and The Moral Machine project.\n",
      "Putting machine learning to work\n",
      "Shulman said executives tend to struggle with understanding where machine learning can actually add value to their company. What’s gimmicky for one company is core to another, and businesses should avoid trends and find business use cases that work for them.\n",
      "Machine learning is changing, or will change, every industry, and leaders need to understand the basic principles, the potential, and the limitations.\n",
      "Aleksander Madry\n",
      "MIT Computer Science Professor\n",
      "Share\n",
      "The way machine learning works for Amazon is probably not going to translate at a car company, Shulman said — while Amazon has found success with voice assistants and voice-operated speakers, that doesn’t mean car companies should prioritize adding speakers to cars. More likely, he said, the car company might find a way to use machine learning on the factory line that saves or makes a great deal of money.\n",
      "“The field is moving so quickly, and that's awesome, but it makes it hard for executives to make decisions about it and to decide how much resourcing to pour into it,” Shulman said.\n",
      "It’s also best to avoid looking at machine learning as a solution in search of a problem, Shulman said. Some companies might end up trying to backport machine learning into a business use. Instead of starting with a focus on technology, businesses should start with a focus on a business problem or customer need that could be met with machine learning. \n",
      "A basic understanding of machine learning is important, LaRovere said, but finding the right machine learning use ultimately rests on people with different expertise working together. “I'm not a data scientist. I'm not doing the actual data engineering work — all the data acquisition, processing, and wrangling to enable machine learning applications — but I understand it well enough to be able to work with those teams to get the answers we need and have the impact we need,” she said. “You really have to work in a team.”\n",
