      "Using Edge Biometrics For Better Office Security System Development\n",
      "Trend #4. Automated Machine Learning for Speed and Cost Cutting \n",
      "As the demand for off-the-shelf solutions in various industries grows, AutoML steps in to provide an accessible and user-friendly solution that doesn’t require deep expertise in machine learning. The AutoML market is projected to reach USD 10.38 billion by 2030, making it one of the most promising technologies of the future. \n",
      "For data scientists engaged in machine learning projects, tasks such as data preprocessing, feature development, modeling, neural network design (if deep learning is involved), post-processing, and result analysis can be complex. While AutoML doesn’t perform these tasks better than humans, it can do them automatically and, therefore, quickly. However, the accuracy might be compromised. In other words, AutoML can work as a part of the system, as it uses templates without considering specific features of the task.\n",
      "AutoML introduces enhanced data labeling tools and the potential for automatic tuning of neural network architectures. Traditionally, data labeling has relied on manual efforts, often outsourced, which introduces the risk of human error. AutoML significantly reduces this risk by automating much of the labeling process. This not only decreases the likelihood of errors but also lowers labor costs, allowing companies to concentrate more on data analysis. By reducing these costs, AutoML contributes to making data analysis, artificial intelligence, and related solutions more affordable and accessible to companies in the market.\n",
      "Examples of popular AutoML platforms include Google Cloud AutoML, H2O.ai, and DataRobot. They offer many AutoML tools and libraries with a wide range of functionalities to integrate into existing workflows.\n",
      "Trend #5. MLOps for More Productivity, Reliability, Monitoring, and Cost Reduction \n",
      "Machine Learning Operationalization Management (MLOps) involves the creation of machine learning software solutions with a keen emphasis on reliability and efficiency. This approach introduces an innovative way to enhance the development of machine learning solutions, making them more adjustable to changes in business goals and data. The increasing volume of data on larger scales necessitates higher levels of automation, which is one of the key reasons why MLOps has become essential in the field of machine learning.\n",
      "One of the major elements of MLOps is the systems life cycle, introduced by the DevOps approach. Understanding the ML systems lifecycle is essential for understanding the importance of MLOps. The general roadmap can look like this: \n",
      "Design a model based on business goals\n",
      "Acquire, process, and prepare data for the ML model\n",
      "Train and tune the ML model\n",
      "Validate ML model\n",
      "Deploy the software solution with an integrated model\n",
      "Monitor and restart the process to improve the ML model: if the model predicts worse or something is wrong with the data, negative changes are detected, and the predefined pipeline for training starts to work, taking into account the metrics of training. \n",
      "If the metrics of training are worse, humen involvement is required. \n",
      "MLOps offers a significant advantage in effectively managing systems at scale. Dealing with challenges at larger scales becomes complex due to factors such as limited capacity in small data science teams, communication gaps between teams, shifting objectives, and more.\n",
      "By adopting a business objective-first design approach, we enhance the entire process of data collection and ML solution implementation. Solutions developed through this approach prioritize considerations such as data relevancy, feature creation, data cleaning, selecting suitable cloud service hosts, and ensuring ease of model training post-deployment in a production environment.\n",
      "Read also:\n",
      "Why, When And How To Use Kubernetes For App Development\n",
      "Trend #6. Low-Code/No-Code Machine Learning for Cost Cutting \n",
      "Low-code/no-code (LCNC) machine learning platforms allow non-AI experts to create AI applications from predefined components. They democratize access to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The no-code AI platforms segment dominated the market even in 2023, being responsible for more than 76% share of the global revenue.\n",
      "Although no-code platforms provide a variety of pre-built components, they may face limitations in accommodating advanced customization. Users might experience constraints in implementing intricate business rules or meeting specific design requirements. Another concern is connected to scalability. While numerous no-code platforms boast scalability features, complex or highly scalable applications may necessitate custom coding for optimal performance. Scaling could be restricted by limitations within the platform’s underlying infrastructure or resource constraints.\n",
      "Overall, low-code and no-code ML platforms are useful for simple ML projects like retail profits, dynamic pricing, and employee retention rates. However, the development of advanced and multifunctional projects with significant business value usually is impossible without the ML engineers’ involvement. It’s obvious that developing advanced ML projects requires a human touch to perform data analysis correctly and efficiently. \n",
      "Trend #7. Unsupervised ML for Streamlining Processes \n",
      "As automation advances, there is a growing need for data science solutions that operate without human intervention. The rise of unsupervised machine learning (ML) represents a promising trend across various industries and use cases. While it is established that machines cannot learn in isolation and require new information for analysis, traditional methods often involve human data scientists inputting this information.\n",
      "Unsupervised ML, however, focuses on unlabeled data, operating without direct guidance from a data scientist. This approach enables machine learning programs to autonomously draw conclusions, rapidly examining data structures to identify potential patterns. This autonomous learning can enhance decision-making processes by automating and refining them further.\n",
      "One effective technique within unsupervised ML is clustering, which involves grouping data points with shared features. This enables machine learning programs to efficiently comprehend data sets and recognize underlying patterns.\n",
      "Learn about utilizing unsupervised machine learning algorithms for pattern identification and anomaly detection in various business cases. \n",
      "Read also:\n",
      "Improve Data Quality With Unsupervised Machine Learning\n",
      "Trend #8. Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing Decision-Making \n",
      "In machine learning, three paradigms exist: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning involves the ML system learning through direct experiences with its environment, where the environment utilizes a reward/punishment system to assign value to the observations made by the ML system. The system aims to achieve the highest level of reward or value, similar to positive reinforcement training for animals.\n",
      "While reinforcement learning finds significant applications in video game and board game AI, caution is warranted when safety is a critical consideration. The algorithm’s reliance on random actions during the learning process might lead to deliberately unsafe decisions, posing risks to users if not monitored. Efforts are underway to develop safer reinforcement learning systems that prioritize safety in their algorithms.\n",
      "The full potential of reinforcement learning as a tool in a data scientist’s arsenal will be realized when it can accomplish real-world tasks without making dangerous or harmful decisions, ensuring its responsible and secure application.\n",
      "Trend #9. Multi-Modal Machine Learning for Enhanced Customer Insights\n",
      "Multi-modal learning teaches a machine to process data and information from multiple modalities at once. These systems are trained on and utilize a combination of video, audio, speech, images, text, and traditional numerical datasets. Moreover, a multi-modal learning project might combine, for example, Natural Language Processing (NLP)  with computer vision.\n",
      "Multi-modal learning involves the simultaneous use of diverse data types to assist AI in understanding content and interpreting context more effectively, addressing limitations seen in earlier AI models.\n",
      "What does it mean in practice? Integrating various data types enables AI to determine the context of an image and make more precise conclusions. For instance, combining an image of a dog with corresponding dog sounds increases the likelihood of accurately identifying the object as a dog. Similarly, pairing facial recognition with Natural Language Processing (NLP) enhances the identification of individuals.\n",
      "Another use case is connected with language processing. Multimodal AI excels in executing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as sentiment analysis.

      "The 8 most popular machine learning trends in 2023\n",
      "As you can see, machine learning has greatly evolved over the last 80 years, and it’s only continuing to advance in sophistication.\n",
      "So, what are the current big trends in machine learning? We’ve put together a list of the most popular and exciting developments in 2023 that’ll dictate the future of this technology.\n",
      "1. General Adversarial Network (GAN)\n",
      "General Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are a kind of neural network structure that uses two sub-models to generate new data. These sub-models are called the generator and the discriminator model. \n",
      "The generator creates fake data, and the discriminator tries to determine whether the data is real or fake. \n",
      "The two models are trained in an adversarial zero-sum game until the generator is able to create more believable data, and the discriminator model is able to be tricked by it more than half the time.\n",
      "GANs are used to generate examples for image datasets, translate images from one domain to another, create future frames of videos based on a given sequence of past frames, and generate 3D models of objects, and scenes from 2D images, just to give you a few examples.\n",
      "2. Low-code and no-code machine learning\n",
      "Low-code and no-code ML solutions allow anyone who doesn’t have extensive coding expertise to develop AI applications. \n",
      "They have a graphical user interface (GUI) with pre-built components including algorithms, data preprocessing tools, and model evaluation metrics.\n",
      "With the two solutions, you can drag and drop the components into a pipeline to assemble them. This way, users can choose the elements they want to include in their applications and specify the parameters.\n",
      "Low-code and no-code are only going to increase in popularity, as they’re so accessible, convenient, and easy to use.\n",
      "3. Embedded ML/TinyML\n",
      "Embedded ML, also known as TinyML, allows machine learning models to run on embedded systems that use microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are small computers designed for a special purpose.\n",
      "With embedded ML/TinyML, you can incorporate AI algorithms directly into devices and systems, and utilize edge computing for real-time processing on the devices.\n",
      "Initially, the machine learning system is trained on existing data, and then embedded into the device or system. Then the device or system can make predictions based on incoming data without needing to transfer and process the data somewhere else.\n",
      "TinyML backs up Internet of Things (IoT) systems which enables them to efficiently process and analyze large quantities of data whilst using up minimal power. \n",
      "TinyML is continuing to grow in adoption. According to ABI Research, TinyML device shipments are set to increase to 2.5 billion in 2030, which is up from 15 million in 2020.\n",
      "4. Multimodal machine learning (MML)\n",
      "Multimodal machine learning (MML) is based on the concept that the world can be perceived through multiple modalities. \n",
      "Multimodality in AI refers to machine learning models that can simultaneously perceive a situation through multiple modalities, similar to what a human can do. Therefore, an ML model being able to perceive the complexities of the world and understand different modalities and how they’re experienced is extremely valuable.\n",
      "By effectively working with different modalities such as text, images, and audio, MML models are able to make predictions or decisions based on an amalgamation of data, which improves its accuracy and overall performance. \n",
      "MML can also be utilized in complex applications such as robotics and autonomous systems, where it’s critical to understand and react to inputs like sensor data, video, and speech.\n",
      "5. Machine learning operations (MLOps) \n",
      "MLOps combines the development and deployment of ML systems to create a more streamlined and efficient process. \n",
      "Data scientists, DevOps engineers, and IT use MLOps to collaborate more effectively and accelerate model development and production by implementing continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices with appropriate monitoring, validation, and governance. \n",
      "In short, MLOps provides a set of guidelines and best practices to develop machine learning applications in the most reliable and systematic way.\n",
      "6. Automated machine learning (AutoML)\n",
      "AutoML is a technology that automates machine learning tasks. This means that it can increase the efficiency of building models, free up time for data scientists to focus on more value-added tasks, and enhance the accuracy of models. \n",
      "AutoML has become so popular in 2023 because:\n",
      "It’s accessible and easy to use for those who aren’t ML experts It helps ML engineers to increase their productivityIt massively reduces errors caused by humansLess time is needed to analyze and model data\n",
      "7. Unsupervised machine learning\n",
      "Unsupervised machine learning is designed to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets and identify patterns and groups. It requires no human intervention and is ideal for handling large quantities of data that can’t be labeled manually.\n",
      "Unsupervised machine learning groups data points with shared features to understand the patterns and relationships between different data sets. As such, it can help users perform accurate and efficient data analysis, and carry out effective cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition activities.\n",
      "8. Responsible AI\n",
      "As ML increases in adoption and accessibility, more organizations are recognizing the importance of responsible AI. Responsible AI refers to the ethical, safe, and transparent use of AI systems. \n",
      "Businesses must consider the impact that AI systems have on their employees, customers, and general society, and ensure they:\n",
      "Are as unbiased and representative as possibleAlign with human valuesEmpower individuals to raise any concerns and appropriately govern the technology Prioritize the privacy and security of personal and sensitive dataMitigate risk and truly benefit key stakeholders, employees, and markets \n",
      "More organizations are incorporating ethical principles into the design of AI systems. For example, Microsoft has developed a ‘Responsible AI Standard’ framework for building AI systems, which is based on six principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.  \n",
      "The future of machine learning\n",
      "Now that we know all about this year’s most popular machine learning trends, what does the future hold for ML?\n",

      "Machine Learning plays a significant role in overcoming challenges like customer churn prediction, fraud detection, etc., in the banking and finance industry. Below is a list of machine learning uses in the finance industry-\n",
      "Uses for Machine Learning in Finance for Fraud Detection\n",
      "Thanks to the e-commerce boom, most of us now purchase products online. With increasing online shopping, fraudulent transactions are also on the rise. Companies use machine learning algorithms to identify and block fraudsters to combat this. You are watching “Game of Thrones” when you get a call from your bank asking if you have swiped your card for “$X” at a store in your city to buy a gadget. It was not you who bought the expensive device using your card; it has been in your pocket all noon. How did the bank flag this purchase as fraudulent? All thanks to Machine Learning algorithms! Financial fraud costs $80 billion annually, of which Americans alone are at risk worth $50 billion per annum.\n",
      "One of the most important goals and applications of machine learning in the banking/finance domain is fraud prevention, i.e., detecting and minimizing any fraudulent activity. Machine learning is best suited for this use case as it can scan through vast amounts of transactional data and identify patterns, i.e., if there is any unusual behavior. Every transaction a customer makes is analyzed in real-time and given a fraud score representing the likelihood of the transaction being fraudulent. In the case of a fraud transaction, the transaction is blocked or handed over for a manual review. All of this happens in the blink of an eye. If the fraud score is above a particular threshold, a rejection will be triggered automatically. This would otherwise be difficult without the application of machine learning, as a human being cannot review thousands of data points in seconds and make a decision.\n",
      "Citibank has collaborated with Portugal-based fraud detection company Feedzai which works in real-time to identify and eliminate fraud in online and in-person banking by alerting the customer.\n",
      "PayPal is using machine learning to fight money laundering. PayPal has several machine-learning tools that compare billions of transactions and can accurately differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions among buyers and sellers.\n",

      "One of the most significant ML techniques is sentiment analysis. Applications of sentiment analysis include campaign monitoring, brand monitoring, stock market analysis, compliance monitoring, etc. Let’s understand sentiment analysis with the most basic implementation - using a word list with scores ranging from +5 (positive) to -5 (negative). For performing sentiment analysis, let’s use the AFINN scored word list. Say one of your customers wrote - I loved the product, but the packaging was not good. In the AFINN word list, ‘loved’ and ‘not good’ have +3 and -2 scores, respectively. If you combine these two scores, you will get +1. This means the user sentiment was mildly positive. Again this is the simplest example of sentiment analysis. Complex models combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze large pieces of data. According to the Amadeus IT group, 90% of American travelers with a smartphone share their photos and travel experience on social media and review services.
