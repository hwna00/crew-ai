      "*For the Main Dish: Greek Lemon Chicken with Potatoes*  \n",
      "- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 1.5 lbs)  \n",
      "- 4 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into wedges  \n",
      "- 4 cloves garlic, minced  \n",
      "- 1/4 cup olive oil  \n",
      "- Juice of 2 large lemons  \n",
      "- Zest of 1 lemon  \n",
      "- 1 tablespoon dried oregano  \n",
      "- 1 teaspoon salt  \n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper  \n",
      "- 1 cup chicken broth  \n",

      "*For the Side Dish: Greek Salad*  \n",
      "- 3 medium tomatoes, diced  \n",
      "- 1 cucumber, diced  \n",
      "- 1 red onion, thinly sliced  \n",
      "- 1 cup Kalamata olives, pitted  \n",
      "- 1 cup feta cheese, crumbled  \n",
      "- 1/4 cup olive oil  \n",
      "- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar  \n",
      "- 1 teaspoon dried oregano  \n",

      "\n",
      "**Preparation Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*For the Greek Lemon Chicken with Potatoes:*  \n",
      "1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).  \n",
      "2. In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well.  \n",
      "3. Add the chicken thighs to the bowl, ensuring they are well coated in the marinade. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator for more flavor.  \n",
      "4. In a large baking dish, arrange the potato wedges. Pour the remaining marinade over them, then place the marinated chicken thighs on top.  \n",
      "5. Pour the chicken broth into the baking dish around the chicken and potatoes.  \n",
      "6. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.  \n",
      "7. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165°F/75°C) and the potatoes are golden and tender.  \n",
      "8. Once done, remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes before serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "*For the Greek Salad:*  \n",
      "1. In a large bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, Kalamata olives, and feta cheese.  \n",
      "2. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper.  \n",
      "3. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine. Adjust seasoning if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Serving Suggestions:**\n",
      "- Serve the Greek Lemon Chicken and Potatoes on a large platter, garnished with chopped fresh parsley.  \n",
      "- Present the Greek Salad in a separate bowl, allowing guests to serve themselves.  \n",
      "- For a complete Greek dining experience, consider serving with warm pita bread and tzatziki sauce as an appetizer.  \n",
