**Preparation Instructions:**

*For the Greek Lemon Chicken with Potatoes:*  
1. Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C).  
2. In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well.  
3. Add the chicken thighs to the bowl, ensuring they are well coated in the marinade. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator for more flavor.  
4. In a large baking dish, arrange the potato wedges. Pour the remaining marinade over them, then place the marinated chicken thighs on top.  
5. Pour the chicken broth into the baking dish around the chicken and potatoes.  
6. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.  
7. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165째F/75째C) and the potatoes are golden and tender.  
8. Once done, remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes before serving.

*For the Greek Salad:*  
1. In a large bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, Kalamata olives, and feta cheese.  
2. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper.  
3. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine. Adjust seasoning if needed.
