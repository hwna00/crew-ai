**Preparation Instructions:**

*For the Greek Lemon Tofu with Potatoes:*  
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).  
2. In a large bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix well.  
3. Cut the tofu into thick slices or cubes and add it to the marinade, ensuring it is well coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator for more flavor.  
4. In a large baking dish, arrange the potato wedges. Pour the remaining marinade over them, then place the marinated tofu on top.  
5. Pour the vegetable broth into the baking dish around the tofu and potatoes.  
6. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.  
7. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the tofu is golden and the potatoes are tender.  
8. Once done, remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes before serving.

*For the Greek Salad:*  
1. In a large bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, Kalamata olives, and feta cheese (or plant-based alternative).  
2. In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper.  
3. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine. Adjust seasoning if needed.
